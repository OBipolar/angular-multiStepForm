angular-multiStepForm
=====================

Multi-Step Form using AngularJS and UI-Router

Have the same/advanced function as the questionaire smaple in angular-test app

## Product Logic
* question
* options
* with specific option, goto different subquestions
* repeat the process, until specific option leads to the answer

## Current Features
* use two view to achieve the animation
* defered update the questionaire databse
* prev and next function to come back and through

## ToDo

## Diff with angular-test app
#### the nav bar (not determined, how to deal with)
1. display all steps
2. display prev, current and next steps (3 in total)

#### the container
1. not partials, only rewrite
